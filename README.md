                            Multiprocessing 

Multiprocessing in python involves running multiple processes,each process runs in its own memory.This is particularly useful for CPU-bound tasks, where the bottleneck lies in the processing power of the CPU.

Key Concepts
Process: A separate instance of a program, with its own memory space and resources.
Process Pool: A pool of worker processes that can be used to execute tasks concurrently.
Process-Safe Data Structures: Data structures that can be safely shared between processes, such as queues and pipes.
Common Use Cases
CPU-Bound Tasks: Tasks that heavily rely on CPU processing power, such as numerical computations, data processing, or machine learning algorithms.
I/O-Bound Tasks: Tasks that involve input/output operations, such as file I/O or network requests. While multiprocessing can help to some extent, it's often more efficient to use asynchronous programming techniques like asyncio for I/O-bound tasks.

Application:Metro Train Simulation with Multiprocessing

Create Trains: Each train will have its own process to simulate its movement.
Define Stations: Stations will be represented by shared data structures.
Implement Train Movement: Trains will move between stations, taking a certain amount of time.
Handle Passenger Boarding and Alighting: Simulate passengers boarding and alighting at stations.

Explanation:
Train Class: Defines a Train class to represent each train. Each train has a unique ID, a list of stations, and a travel time between stations.
Train Movement: The run method simulates the train's movement by updating the current station and printing a message.
Passenger Simulation: A basic simulation of passenger boarding and alighting is included, but you can implement more complex logic based on specific requirements.
Main Process: Creates multiple Train processes and starts them. The main process keeps running to prevent early termination.
Enhancements:
Passenger Tracking: Implement a system to track the number of passengers on each train.
Station Capacity: Limit the number of passengers at each station.
Delay Simulation: Introduce random delays to simulate real-world scenarios.
Visualization: Use libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly to visualize the train movements.
User Interface: Create a user interface to control the simulation and view real-time updates.
This is a basic simulation of a metro train system using multiprocessing. You can customize and expand upon this code to create more complex and realistic scenarios.
